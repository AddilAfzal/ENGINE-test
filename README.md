# About  
This repository contains code for my (Addil Afzal) attempt at [ENGINE](https://enginegroup.com/)'s skills assessment, implemented in ReactJS.  

The task was to create a web application that would display live arrival times for services running through Great Portland Street station.

# Features
- Arrival times are grouped and then displayed by platform.
- The list of scheduled arrivals is ordered by time (most recent first).
- The label for each service is colour coded accordingly.
- Service status is shown for all lines running through the station.
- Clicking on to an arrival shows further information about the current position of the train.
- Information displayed is updated every 20 seconds.
